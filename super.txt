Be careful with the urls. They differ between https and ssh and the posts on this page don't make it that clear. Each git project has a .git/config file in the project root directory. There you can set the remote and branch information. Setting the remote for https: url = github.com/<yourGitUserName>/<yourGitProject>.git While for git+ssh: url = git@github.com:<yourGitUserName>/<yourGitProject>.git Having the wrong url causes the public-key permission denied error which is probably not a very clear error
