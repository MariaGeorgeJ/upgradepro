Git is a an open source distributed version control system that is available for free under the GNU General Public License version 2. The Git source code is hosted on GitHub, from where it can be downloaded or installed. Users can also utilize one of the binary installers to deploy Git on their systems. For example, they can use sudo to install Git on Linux, Homebrew on Mac or a downloadable executable file on Windows.

Git is used primarily by developers to manage their source code. Git records changes to files over time, while ensuring the integrity of those changes at each stage of processing. Users can revert to earlier versions and compare different versions at the file level. They can also branch and merge files to support independent development efforts and nonlinear workflows. And Git is not limited to source code. It can be used for database scripts, LaTeX documents, configuration files, content management data or other file types.
